This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.5.0.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Initial configuration

It is assumed that Node.js is installed in the hosting machine before any actions. If this is not the case, it can be done by accessing the respective link [here](https://nodejs.org/en/).

For installing the Angular CLI the command `npm install -g @angular/cli` has to be typed in the console.

Once this step is done, the next thing to do is to install the dependencies. First ensure the console is pointing to the right project folder, then type `ng install` in the console for setting the project dependencies.


## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
